      <p class='paragraph info'>
        I feel nostalgic for the good old days when avocado toast was something novel,
        a little breakfast secret to share with friends. Avocado toast these days, well,
        it's gone mainstream. But that doesn't mean we should take it for granted.

        that avocado toast count â€” every slice should be extra special!

        worthy of the avocado itself. And all you need are two ingredients to make any
        one of these fancied-up avocado toasts.
